Do you still think he has it in him, or has that ship sailed away?They are my all time favorites. I love when he stretches his vocals, but ive seen later(2023) concert videos with sign of the times where he didn't even attempt to carry the ending. Even with his songs like Adore You, he would speak sing at concerts \"walk through fire for you, just let me adore you\", instead of belting it like he used to.Do you think it is inability to carry those vocals, or is it him preserving his vocals so he can perform longer?",
